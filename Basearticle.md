Mushroom Species Information (Danmarks Svampeatlas)

Below is comprehensive information on the specified mushroom species, compiled and translated from Danmarks Svampeatlas (the Danish Fungal Atlas). Each species section includes taxonomy, description (morphology), habitat/ecology, distribution, seasonality, known lookalikes, and other relevant details from the Svampeatlas checklist.

Psilocybe semilanceata (Liberty Cap)

Taxonomy
Classification: Kingdom Fungi; Phylum Basidiomycota; Class Agaricomycetes; Order Agaricales; Family Strophariaceae; Genus Psilocybe; Psilocybe semilanceata.
(Danish name: Spids nøgenhat)

Description
A small psilocybin mushroom with a distinctive conical cap. Caps are ± olive-gray, with striate (grooved) margins, greasy when moist, and dry out quickly. The cap is typically tall with a small pointed papilla (nipple-like bump) at the apex. The stem is slender, smooth, and pale, and the gills are initially brownish, becoming dark purple-brown as spores mature (due to the dark spore print). There is no ring or veil on the stem (hence “nøgenhat”, meaning “naked cap”). The flesh has no strong odor or taste.

Habitat and Ecology
Grows in grassy meadows, pastures, and other nutrient-rich grasslands often among moss. It commonly appears in sheep or cow pastures but does not grow directly on dung—rather in rich soil fertilized by grazing animals. Often found in upland or coastal grasslands and lawns that are not plowed. Saprotrophic, decomposing grassland debris.

Distribution
Widespread and common in Denmark. Recorded throughout the country and considered fairly common (ret almindelig). Occurs in suitable habitats across northern Europe and other temperate regions; in Denmark it shows no particular regional restriction.

Seasonality
Fruiting in late summer through autumn, typically August to November, with occasional early appearances from July. Peak season is autumn (especially September–October). Cool, wet conditions trigger large flushes.

Lookalikes
Primarily confused with Psilocybe strictipes, a very similar small psilocybe; P. strictipes (if distinct) tends to have a cap that opens more flat with age and slightly smaller spores (~10–13 µm long). Novices might confuse worn, dried specimens with Panaeolina foenisecii (brown Mottlegill) in lawns, but that species has different spore color and does not bruise blue. Blue bruising and a dark purple-brown spore print support identification.

Other Information
Conservation Status: Least Concern (LC) on the 2019 Danish Red List.
Edibility: Poisonous—contains psilocybin and related hallucinogenic compounds; illegal to consume and potentially dangerous.
Records: ~396 Danish observations.

Psilocybe cyanescens (Wavy Cap)

Taxonomy
Classification: Kingdom Fungi; Phylum Basidiomycota; Class Agaricomycetes; Order Agaricales; Family Strophariaceae; Genus Psilocybe; Psilocybe cyanescens.
(Danish name: Blånende nøgenhat)

Description
A potent wood-inhabiting psilocybin mushroom with wavy caps. Caps are chestnut-brown to caramel-brown, often developing a wavy, undulating margin in age. Flesh bruises blue when damaged. Gills are dark purple-brown (blackish when loaded with spores). The stem is pale to brownish, often bruising blue-green, and has no ring. Spores are black, smooth, and elliptic. The combination of black spores and blue-staining flesh is characteristic.

Habitat and Ecology
Grows in clusters on woody debris, especially on wood chips, mulched garden beds, or compost. Saprotrophic, favoring lignin-rich substrates in man-made environments (parks, gardens). Thought to be introduced via imported wood mulch rather than native to natural habitats.

Distribution
Extremely rare in Denmark. Newly recorded, non-native species with very few finds (only 9 atlas records). Found scattered in eastern Denmark where wood mulch usage is common. Considered an exotic or casual species.

Seasonality
Fruiting in early autumn (September–October) in Denmark; appears after autumn rains in cool conditions.

Lookalikes
No typical Danish species closely resemble it in its habitat. Distinctive as a wood-chip mushroom with black spores and blue-black bruising. To the untrained eye it might be confused with Galerina or Pholiotina on wood chips (deadly poisonous), but those have brown spores and do not bruise blue. Blue bruising and a dark purplish-black spore print distinguish it.

Other Information
Conservation Status: Not Applicable (NA) on the Danish Red List (introduced).
Edibility: Poisonous—high in psilocybin; not for consumption.
Records: 9 finds in the atlas (as of 2019).

Panaeolus cinctulus (Banded Mottlegill)

Taxonomy
Classification: Kingdom Fungi; Phylum Basidiomycota; Class Agaricomycetes; Order Agaricales; Family Bolbitiaceae; Genus Panaeolus; Panaeolus cinctulus.
(Danish name: Randbæltet glanshat)

Description
A small to medium brown mushroom with mottled gills, common in manured soils. Cap is convex to bell-shaped, fairly fleshy, and hygrophanous with a zoned, banded pattern when moist—typically yellow-brown to reddish-brown with a darker band at the margin when wet. No ring on the stalk. Gills are grey-brown to blackish with distinctive mottling (due to uneven spore maturation). Spores are black, smooth, slightly elongated-elliptical, only slightly flattened on one side (~11–14 × 7.5–10 µm), lacking oily droplets. Stem is slender, fibrous, and pale to brown; no ring.

Habitat and Ecology
Typically on nutrient-rich substrates: well-fertilized lawns, compost heaps, horse manure piles, or heavily manured soil. In Denmark it can appear in stables, pastures (on old dung), or nutrient-enriched grassy areas. Solitary to scattered or in small groups. Saprotrophic on dung and organic matter.

Distribution
Recorded “here and there across most of the country” (hist og her over det meste af landet)—widespread in Denmark but not abundant. Found throughout, especially near grazing livestock or compost. Widely distributed but infrequent (likely under-reported).

Seasonality
Fruiting from late spring through autumn; Danish records span May–November, most in summer and early fall. Often after rain during warm weather.

Lookalikes
Other Panaeolus species, notably:

P. papilionaceus (Common Mottlegill): more fragile, distinctly bell-shaped cap; may show whitish veil remnants on the margin when young.

P. semiovatus (Ringed Mottlegill): much larger, prominent ring, grows directly on dung.

P. acuminatus and P. subfirmus: related brown species; separated by spore size/shape (some with more angular or larger spores).
Outside Panaeolus, few lawn mushrooms have both mottled gills and a black spore print. Psilocybe may bruise blue; Panaeolina foenisecii has dark brown (not jet black) spores.

Other Information
Conservation Status: Least Concern (LC) on the 2019 Danish Red List.
Edibility: Poisonous/psychoactive—contains low levels of psychoactive tryptamines; not for consumption.
Records: ~63 Danish finds.

Amanita pantherina (Panther Cap)

Taxonomy
Classification: Kingdom Fungi; Phylum Basidiomycota; Class Agaricomycetes; Order Agaricales; Family Amanitaceae; Genus Amanita; Amanita pantherina.
(Danish name: Panterfluesvamp)

Description
A medium-sized, brownish poisonous Amanita with white spots. Cap is gray-brown to leather-brown, relatively small (4–10 cm) and often with a finely striate margin, bearing small, stark white warty patches (universal-veil remnants). Stem is whitish to pale brown with a smooth, unstriated ring. At the base, a distinct bulb with an abrupt rimmed margin (a bulbous volva with a pronounced rim). Flesh is white with no strong odor. Gills are white and free. Spores are ellipsoid, not amyloid, about 10–12 × 7–9 μm in size.

Habitat and Ecology
Ectomycorrhizal with both deciduous and coniferous trees on calcareous or sandy soils. In Denmark found with oak, beech, hazel, and in pine or spruce plantations; also along forest edges and paths. Occurs in coastal dune plantations with pines in western Jutland.

Distribution
Widely distributed and fairly common in eastern Denmark (east of the glacial “israndslinie”), present but less frequent in western Jutland (notably dunes and pine plantations). Over 1,600 Danish records indicate a common species in suitable habitats.

Seasonality
Fruiting June–October, peaking late summer to early fall; occasional November fruiting in mild years.

Lookalikes
Chief lookalike: Amanita excelsa (Høj fluesvamp) = A. spissa: larger, dingier grayish warts, distinctly striate ring, lacks a pronounced rimmed bulb; spores amyloid (vs. non-amyloid in A. pantherina).
Also: Amanita rubescens (Blusher) reddens when damaged, has buff/grayish warts, striate ring, and lacks a distinct rim at the base. Weathered forms of other Amanita unlikely to confuse if ring/volva and reddening reaction are checked.

Other Information
Conservation Status: Least Concern (LC) on the 2019 Danish Red List.
Edibility: Deadly poisonous—contains ibotenic acid and muscimol; causes Pantherina syndrome (delirium, hallucinations, severe GI symptoms; high doses can cause convulsions/coma).
Records: ~1,621 Danish finds.

Amanita muscaria (Fly Agaric)

Taxonomy
Classification: Kingdom Fungi; Phylum Basidiomycota; Class Agaricomycetes; Order Agaricales; Family Amanitaceae; Genus Amanita; Amanita muscaria.
(Danish name: Rød fluesvamp)

Description
An iconic large red mushroom with white spots. Cap bright red to orange-red (sometimes fading to yellow-orange), usually 6–20 cm, with white warty patches (universal-veil remnants) that can wash off. Cap can be shiny and sticky when wet. Gills white, crowded, and free. Stem white, stout, with a swollen base and a white, skirt-like, finely striate ring near the top. Base forms a bulbous volva with concentric scale rings rather than a free sac. Flesh white, does not change on cutting; mild odor. Spores white, smooth, globose to subglobose (~9–11 µm), amyloid.

Habitat and Ecology
Ectomycorrhizal with birch, pine, spruce, oak, and others. In Denmark found in heaths, woodlands with birch and pine, and parks. Favors acidic, sandy soils but also occurs in mixed broadleaf forests. Often in fairy rings or scattered groups.

Distribution
Very common and widespread across Denmark wherever host trees grow; among the most frequently observed mushrooms.

Seasonality
Fruiting late summer and autumn, typically September–November; first appearances often in August (or July in warm years). Abundant in September–October, lingering into November; occasionally into early December in mild southern/coastal areas.

Lookalikes
A typical fresh Fly Agaric is essentially unmistakable. Old, washed-out caps missing white flakes may resemble red-capped Russula species, but Russula lacks ring and volva and has brittle flesh. Amanita caesarea (not native in Denmark) has an orange-red, striate-margined cap without white warts. Amanita regalis is a brown “variant” with white spots.

Other Information
Conservation Status: Least Concern (LC) in Denmark.
Edibility: Poisonous—contains ibotenic acid and muscimol; causes nausea, vertigo, delirium, hallucinations, CNS depression. Not usually fatal but can cause serious illness; do not eat.
Records: ~5,391 Danish finds.
